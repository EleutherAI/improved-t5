        "47-year-old Susan Boyle from Blackburn, West Lothian in Scotland, made her debut appearance on the show on Saturday night by saying that she had \"never been married, never been kissed\" and was currently unemployed, living alone at home with her cat, Pebbles. She says that she wants to \"be a professional singer\", but has \"never been given the chance.\" Audience members and judges Amanda Holden, Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan, first laughed and even poked fun at her. Boyle then stunned the judges and audience, getting a standing ovation, with her performance of I Dreamed a Dream from the award winning musical performance Les Misérables. Cowell called her performance \"extraordinary\" while Morgan called it \"the biggest surprise I've had in three years of this show. I am shocked.\" Holden even admitted that \"everyone was against you [Boyle]\" and that \"we were all being very cynical.\"\nDoes this next sentence follow, given the preceding text?\nSimon Cowell fell in love with Susan Boyle.\n\nOPTIONS:\n- yes\n- no",

        "Former WBA heavyweight champ Greg Page, who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at his Louisville home at the age of 50. According to Page's wife, the ex-champ died from complications due to boxing injuries and paralysis. Following a successful amateur career, Page went 58-17-1 during a professional career that began in 1979 and included wins over Jimmy Young, James Tillis, Renaldo Snipes, Gerrie Coetzee (for the WBA title), James 'Bonecrusher' Smith and Tim Witherspoon. Page's losses read like a who's who of heavyweights of the 1980s: Trevor Berbick, Witherspoon, Tony Tubbs, Buster Douglas, Joe Bugner, Orlin Norris, Donovan 'Razor' Ruddock, Bruce Seldon, Monte Barrett and Jorge Luis Gonzalez.\nDoes this next sentence follow, given the preceding text?\nGreg Page was a boxer.\n\nOPTIONS:\n- yes\n- no",
