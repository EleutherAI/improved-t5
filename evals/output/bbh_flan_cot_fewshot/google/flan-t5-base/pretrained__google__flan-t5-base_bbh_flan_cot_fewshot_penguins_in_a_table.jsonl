        "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.\n\n Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nHow many penguins are less than 8 years old?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThis question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.\nNow, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.\nThe penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.\nThere are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).  Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?\nOptions:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThis question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.\nAccording to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.\nThe youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).  Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?\nOptions:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThis question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\nWhen we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.\nThe name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.\nThe name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
