(D) The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\nA: ",

Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Gal\u00e1pagos finch ancestor?\n(A) The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.
