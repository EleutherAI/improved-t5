Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA:  (C)\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA:  (D)\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA:  (A)\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA:  (B)\n\nQ: What difference will urbanisation make for hunger and malnutrition?\n(A) No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries. (B) It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas. (C) Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases. (D) Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\nA: ",
