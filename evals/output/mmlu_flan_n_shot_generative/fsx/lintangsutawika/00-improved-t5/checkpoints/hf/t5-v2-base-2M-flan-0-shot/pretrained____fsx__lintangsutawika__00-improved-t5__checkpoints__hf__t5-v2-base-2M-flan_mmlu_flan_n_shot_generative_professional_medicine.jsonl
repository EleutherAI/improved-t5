The babysitter says, \"He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy.\" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7\u00b0C (101.7\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%. In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n(A) Intravenous aminophylline therapy (B) Intravenous antibiotic therapy (C) Intubation (D) Oral dexamethasone therapy\nA: ",

She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n(A) \u03b2-Adrenergic agonist (B) Cholinesterase inhibitor (C) Dopamine agonist (D) Prednisone\nA: ",

The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, \"I'd rather die than be intubated again.\" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, \"No, I want to die at home.\" Her daughter takes you aside and says, \"My mother doesn't know what she's saying.
