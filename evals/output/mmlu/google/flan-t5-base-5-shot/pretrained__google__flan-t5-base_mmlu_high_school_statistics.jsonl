Each morning the first 30 bearings produced are pulled and measured. If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings\nAnswer:",

She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\nAnswer:",

To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nWhich of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nTina\u2019s science fair project was to estimate the mean amount of chemicals in her city\u2019s water supply. At first, she had decided to use a random sample of 15 observations. But her teacher asked her to take 35 observations. The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations?\nA. There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\nB. There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\nC. There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations.\nD. There is some advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\nAnswer:",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams.

However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB.
