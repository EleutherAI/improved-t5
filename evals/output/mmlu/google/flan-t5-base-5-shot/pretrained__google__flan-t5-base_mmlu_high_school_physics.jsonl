At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nA. 10 W\nB. 30 W\nC. 60 W\nD. 240 W\nAnswer: D\n\nA point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\nA. 3.5 J\nB. 6.0 J\nC. 22.5 J\nD. 40 J\nAnswer: B\n\nWhen hot water is poured into a beaker containing cold alcohol, the temperature of the mixture will eventually reach the same temperature. Considering the scale of the size of the molecules of the fluids, which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\nA. The high temperature water will rise to the top of the container until it has cooled and then mixes with the alcohol.\nB. The molecules of the water continue to have a higher kinetic energy than the molecules of the alcohol, but the two liquids mix until the energy is spread evenly throughout the container.\nC. The hot water produces thermal radiation that is absorbed by the cold alcohol until the kinetic energy of all the molecules is the same.\nD. The water molecules collide with the alcohol molecules, transferring energy until the average kinetic energy of both the water and alcohol molecules are the same.\nAnswer:",

At first, the circuit is disconnected. Then, the circuit is connected, and the light bulb lights. After the light bulb has been lit for a few moments, how has the net charge residing on the circuit elements changed?\nA. The net charge has become more positive.\nB. The net charge has become more negative.\nC. The net charge has not changed.\nD. Whether the net charge becomes more positive or more negative depends on the initial net charge residing on the circuit elements before the bulb was lit.\nAnswer:",
