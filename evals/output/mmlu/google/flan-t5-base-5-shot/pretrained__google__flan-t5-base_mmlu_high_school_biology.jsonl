Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Gal\u00e1pagos finch ancestor?\nA. The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nB. South American predators limited evolution of the mainland finch.\nC. Reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland.\nD. The available niches that the Darwin's finches exploited on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.\nAnswer:",

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\nAnswer:",

During that time, the population was never fewer than 30 squirrels and never more than 45. Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. Which inference(s) about this population might be true?\nA. The amount of available food may have increased.\nB. The number of predators may have decreased.\nC.
