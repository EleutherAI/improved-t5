        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nYou are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy does Earth have the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds?\nA. It is by far the largest terrestrial world.\nB. It is the most volcanically active world.\nC. It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\nD.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nYou are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nHow does the greenhouse effect work?\nA. Ozone transmits visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorbs most of the infrared heat trapping the heat near the surface.\nB. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\nC. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared light from the Sun which then heats the atmosphere and the surface.\nD. Greenhouse gases absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light from the Sun which then heat the atmosphere and the surface.\nAnswer:",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\nYou are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?\nA. Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.\nB. Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.\nC. Saturn is further from the Sun thus cooler and therefore less compact.\nD. Saturn's rings make the planet look bigger.\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nImagine that the Earth was instantly moved to an orbit three times further away from the Sun. How much longer would a year be?\nA. exactly 3 times longer\nB. about 5.2 times longer\nC. Not enough information. It will depend on the inclination of the new orbit\nD. The length of the year wouldn't change because the Earth's mass stays the same.\nAnswer:",

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy do Uranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds but Jupiter and Saturn do not?\nA.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nThe terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because\nA. the entire planets are made mostly of metal.\nB. metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.\nC. metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.\nD. radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.\nAnswer:",

How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy do jovian planets bulge around the equator that is have a \"squashed\" appearance?\nA. Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more.\nB. They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets.\nC. Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\nD. Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.\nAnswer:",

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?\nA. In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\nB. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\nC. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\nD.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nHow do astronomers think Jupiter generates its internal heat?\nA. through exothermic chemical reactions converting chemical potential energy into thermal energy\nB. nuclear fusion\nC. by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy\nD. internal friction due to its rapid rotation rate and differential rotation\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhat do meteorites reveal about the solar system?\nA. They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.\nB. They reveal that meteorites are much older than the comets and planets.\nC.
