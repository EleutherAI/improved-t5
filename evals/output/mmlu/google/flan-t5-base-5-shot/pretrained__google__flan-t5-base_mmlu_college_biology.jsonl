Spliceosomes\nAnswer: B\n\nA recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\nAnswer:",

Telomeres\nB. Centromeres\nC. Nucleosomes\nD. Spliceosomes\nAnswer: B\n\nIn Sweden, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) severely limits populations of its prey, including hares. However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\nD. Fox populations will increase and hare populations will decrease.\nAnswer:",
