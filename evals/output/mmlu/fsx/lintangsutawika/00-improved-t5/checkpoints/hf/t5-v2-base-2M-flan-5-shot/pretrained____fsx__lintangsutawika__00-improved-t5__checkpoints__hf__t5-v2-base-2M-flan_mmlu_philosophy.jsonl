For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA. from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB. since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC. our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD. since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\nAnswer:",
