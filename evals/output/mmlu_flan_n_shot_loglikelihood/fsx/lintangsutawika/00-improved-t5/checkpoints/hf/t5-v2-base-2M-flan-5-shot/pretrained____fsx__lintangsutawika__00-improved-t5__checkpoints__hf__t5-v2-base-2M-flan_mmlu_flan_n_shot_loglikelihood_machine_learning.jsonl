        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about machine learning.\n\nQ: A 6-sided die is rolled 15 times and the results are: side 1 comes up 0 times; side 2: 1 time; side 3: 2 times; side 4: 3 times; side 5: 4 times; side 6: 5 times. Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing?\n(A) 2.0/15 (B) 1.0/7 (C) 3.0/16 (D) 1.0/5\nA:  (B)\n\nQ: To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?\n(A) around 10 examples (B) around 100 examples (C) between 100 and 500 examples (D) more than 1000 examples\nA:  (D)\n\nQ: Which image data augmentation is most common for natural images?\n(A) random crop and horizontal flip (B) random crop and vertical flip (C) posterization (D) dithering\nA:  (A)\n\nQ: Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold.

From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:\n(A) It is too computationally expensive.
