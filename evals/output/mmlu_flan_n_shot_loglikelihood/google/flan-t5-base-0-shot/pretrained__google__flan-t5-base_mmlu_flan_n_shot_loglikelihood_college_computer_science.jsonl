        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer science.\n\nQ: Function signatures describe the types of the arguments to a function as well as the return value of the function. For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of\nadd : real x real -> real\nsince it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature\nadd : real -> (real -> real)\nwhich means that add takes a single real (the first operand) and returns a new function that itself takes a single real (the second operand) and returns a real (the result). This process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments is called currying. Which of the following is correct?\n(A) Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument. (B) Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments. (C) Currying cannot be applied to functions that return functions as arguments. (D) Currying cannot be applied w functions that haw arguments that are functions.\nA: ",
