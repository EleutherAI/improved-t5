Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n(A) Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition. (B) Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated. (C) DDT is generally a very effective insecticide.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school biology.\n\nQ: The same gene that causes various coat patterns in wild and domesticated cats also causes the cross-eyed condition in these cats, the cross-eyed condition being slightly maladaptive. In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n(A) Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population. (B) Phenotype is often the result of compromise. (C) Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time. (D) Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\nA: ",
