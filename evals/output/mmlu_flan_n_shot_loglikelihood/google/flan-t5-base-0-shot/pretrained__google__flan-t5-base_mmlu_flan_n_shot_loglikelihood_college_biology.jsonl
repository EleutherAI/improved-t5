        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college biology.\n\nQ: A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n(A) The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. (B) The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment. (C) The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents. (D) The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\nA: ",

(B) Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization. (C) Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. (D) Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\nA: ",
