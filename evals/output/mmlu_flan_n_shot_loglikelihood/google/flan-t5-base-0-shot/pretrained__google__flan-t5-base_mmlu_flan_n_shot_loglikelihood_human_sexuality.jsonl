According to psychological theory, what is the most likely reason Benny finds this alluring?\n(A) As a child be became sexually aroused pretending to be a powerful executive, so he now becomes aroused at work and must discharge this when he gets home. (B) He is overcome with feelings of self doubt and his sadomasochistic behaviour allows him a safe outlet for that self doubt. (C) He is overwhelmed with pressures and responsibilities at work, and the masochistic behaviour allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual. (D) He is secretly fascinated by violence and engaging in sadomasochistic behaviour is a relatively safe outlet for it.\nA: ",
