(B) The requirement for dietary protein is for individual amino acids, not simply the total amount of protein in the diet. (C) All dietary proteins have the same amino acid content and composition. (D) For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\nA: ",

(C) The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption (D) Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported\nA: ",

(D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA:  (C)\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA:  (D)\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA:  (A)\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA:  (B)\n\nQ: For certain micronutrients, 'biochemical functional indices' have been developed, to assess the adequacy of one or more biochemical pathways that respond predictably to changes in status of that specific micronutrient. One example is serum methylmalonic acid as a biochemical functional index for vitamin B12 status. What is the primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements?\n(A) To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient. (B) To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects. (C) To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion. (D) To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\nA: ",
