(D) legitimize his kingship, since his father was not royal.\nA:  (D)\n\nQ: Researchers now believe that the decline of the Maya was caused chiefly by:\n(A) a cataclysm of some kind, such as an earthquake, volcano, or tsunami. (B) ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn farming techniques. (C) endless wars between neighboring Mayan city-states.
