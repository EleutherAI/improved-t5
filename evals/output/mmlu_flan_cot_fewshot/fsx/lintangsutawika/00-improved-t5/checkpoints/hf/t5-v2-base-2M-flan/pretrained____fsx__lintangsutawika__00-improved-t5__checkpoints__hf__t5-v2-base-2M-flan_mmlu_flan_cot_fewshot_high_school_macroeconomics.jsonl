We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Supply-side fiscal policy stimulates the economy by encouraging more production of goods and services through reduction in taxes and deregulation. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: The short-run Phillips curve indicates a\n(A) direct relation between unemployment and inflation (B) direct relation between price and quantity demanded (C) inverse relation between price and quantity demanded (D) inverse relation between unemployment and inflation\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. The short-run Phillips curve shows that whenever unemployment decreases below a natural level, the inflation starts increasing, and vice-versa. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Holding all else equal which of the following monetary policies would be used to boost U.S. exports?\n(A) Increasing the discount rate (B) Increasing the reserve ratio (C) Buying government securities (D) Lowering tariffs\nA: Let's think step by step.

We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Supply-side fiscal policy stimulates the economy by encouraging more production of goods and services through reduction in taxes and deregulation. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: The short-run Phillips curve indicates a\n(A) direct relation between unemployment and inflation (B) direct relation between price and quantity demanded (C) inverse relation between price and quantity demanded (D) inverse relation between unemployment and inflation\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. The short-run Phillips curve shows that whenever unemployment decreases below a natural level, the inflation starts increasing, and vice-versa. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Holding all else equal which of the following monetary policies would be used to boost U.S. exports?\n(A) Increasing the discount rate (B) Increasing the reserve ratio (C) Buying government securities (D) Lowering tariffs\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Buying government securities leads to reduction in demand for US dollars from foreign buyers, thereby making it cheaper and hence making US exports more attractive.

(D) federal spending exceeds federal tax revenues.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help.
