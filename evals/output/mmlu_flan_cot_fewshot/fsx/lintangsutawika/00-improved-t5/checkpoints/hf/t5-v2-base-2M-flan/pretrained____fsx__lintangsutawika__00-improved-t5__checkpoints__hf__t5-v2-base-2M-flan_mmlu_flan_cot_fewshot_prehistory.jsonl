We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. The average cranium capacity of Homo erectus is less than 1000 cubic cm. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: According to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification and political power at Cahokia suggests:\n(A) a center of Mississippian civilization with conditions similar to the rise of early states. (B) the limitations of authority in a Native American society of egalitarian foragers. (C) a simple chiefdom or perhaps a complex chiefdom had evolved by A.D. 1500. (D) a center of Mississippian civilization with conditions similar to societies on the Northwest Coast of North America.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. Timothy Pauketat is known for his research on Cahokia, the center of the Mississippian culture, where he found similar conditions to the rise of early states. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene indicates there was (as of 2020):\n(A) a great amount of species diversity, or a single species that exhibited a lot of diversity. (B) very little species diversity during this period and very few hominids. (C) decreased species diversity due to a prolonged ice age followed by a severe drought. (D) decreased species diversity but increased numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating stone tool manufacture.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. Recent research has recognized multiple hominid species from the Middle Pliocene, meaning that there is a great amount of species diversity or diversity in a single species. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Researchers now believe that the decline of the Maya was caused chiefly by:\n(A) a cataclysm of some kind, such as an earthquake, volcano, or tsunami. (B) ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn farming techniques. (C) endless wars between neighboring Mayan city-states. (D) practices of interbreeding that led to a steep rise in congenital disorders.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. Researchers believe that the Maya collapse was mainly caused by over-exploitation of natural resources like the slash-and-burn farming techniques. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: The great Mayan king Pacal built temples in the city of Palenque in order to:\n(A) satisfy the powerful Mayan astronomer priests. (B) display his generosity to the common people, since they were allowed to live in the temples. (C) frighten away enemies, in particular the Spaniards. (D) legitimize his kingship, since his father was not royal.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help.
