        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\n(A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation. (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C) Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D) Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Child soliders as a political topic can be missed when they are considered passive victims of warfare. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Human security focuses on a person or population whereas state-centric approaches focus on the state while deprioritizing human security. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\n(A) As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security. (B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response. (D) As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\n(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).Q: Which of these statements best defines social constructivism?\n(A) Social constructivism argues that security can be constructed, and that the human world is not given or natural but instead is a product of human actors. (B) Social constructivism only studies aspects of the international system that are based in the societal sphere, such as issues of poverty, race relations and gender.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\n(A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation. (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C) Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D) Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Child soliders as a political topic can be missed when they are considered passive victims of warfare. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Human security focuses on a person or population whereas state-centric approaches focus on the state while deprioritizing human security. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\n(A) As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security. (B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response. (D) As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\n(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands.

(B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).Q: Which of the following is the best way to control the international arms trade?\n(A) There is no effective mechanism for controlling the global defence trade, as illustrated by the failures of arms control measures in the 20th and 21st century. (B) Despite significant challenges, effective arms control of the complex defence trade can be achieved. For this to be possible will require cooperation and compromise between governments and other actors. (C) A complete ban on weapons and arms trade is the only comprehensive solution to the problems arising from the global arms trade. (D) Non-governmental rather than state or government agencies are best placed to develop the comprehensive and complex solutions needed to tackle challenges arising from the global defence trade.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\n(A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation. (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C) Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D) Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Child soliders as a political topic can be missed when they are considered passive victims of warfare. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.\nA: Let's think step by step.

(B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm.

A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\n(A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation. (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C) Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D) Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Child soliders as a political topic can be missed when they are considered passive victims of warfare. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system.

(B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response.

To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\n(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).Q: According to Waltz, how can a state achieve security?\n(A) By ensuring they have the power to protect themselves from attack, power that is gained either through internal or external balancing. (B) Through the accumulation of territory and other material resources needed to physically defend themselves. (C) By creating an international security environment in which their alliance is fundamentally important to potential aggressors. (D) Through a combination of military and economic measures that secure the state's position as the leader in a competitive international system.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?\n(A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation. (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere.

The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security.

Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Human security focuses on a person or population whereas state-centric approaches focus on the state while deprioritizing human security. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\n(A) As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security. (B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response. (D) As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\n(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).Q: What can social constructivism offer to the discipline of Security Studies?\n(A) The social constructivist perspective has been largely criticised in its failure to be applicable to contemporary conflict situations. The strength of the approach lies in its application to theories of social security. (B) Social constructivism supports realist theory and provides ontological clarification for some of the questions raised by the traditionalist approach. (C) The social constructivist perspective offers the possibility of moving beyond the logic of anarchy that underpins the realist approach to security studies. (D) Security studies is best approached using a social constructivist perspective, as this will aide the formulation of empirically testable theories and reveal truths about the international system for further investigation.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications.

The answer is (D).\n\nQ: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system.

(B) As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response. (D) As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?\n(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).Q: Is the provision of security policy against terrorism a problematic pursuit?\n(A) Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. (B) Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. (C) All of these options. (D) A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\n\nQ: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\nA: Let's think step by step.

(A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely not end terrorism.

(B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere.
