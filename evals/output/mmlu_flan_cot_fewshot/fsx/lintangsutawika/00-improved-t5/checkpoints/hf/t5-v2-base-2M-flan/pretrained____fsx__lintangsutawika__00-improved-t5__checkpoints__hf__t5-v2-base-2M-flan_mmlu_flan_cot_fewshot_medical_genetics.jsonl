We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Prophase I is the stage of meiosis where homologous chromosomes pair with each other and exchange genetic material. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: DNA ligase is\n(A) an enzyme that joins fragments in normal DNA replication (B) an enzyme of bacterial origin which cuts DNA at defined base sequences (C) an enzyme that facilitates transcription of specific genes (D) an enzyme which limits the level to which a particular nutrient reaches\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. DNA ligase is a type of enzyme (EC 6.5.1.1) responsible for joining DNA strands together by catalyzing a phosphodiester bond. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?\n(A) Pyloric stenosis (B) Schizophrenia (C) Spina bifida (neural tube defects) (D) Marfan syndrome\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Multifactorial inheritance is when more than a single factor is responsible for causing a given trait or health problem. Genes cannot be the only factor. Marfan syndrome, on the other hand, requires only one abnormal copy of the of the Marfan gene, from one parent, to inherit the trait. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A gene showing codominance\n(A) has both alleles independently expressed in the heterozygote (B) has one allele dominant to the other (C) has alleles tightly linked on the same chromosome (D) has alleles expressed at the same time in development\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Codominance, as it relates to genetics, refers to a type of genetic inheritance where the phenotype of both the parents is easily observed in the offspring. A heterozygote is an individual having two different alleles of a gene. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Large triplet repeat expansions can be detected by:\n(A) polymerase chain reaction. (B) single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. (C) Southern blotting. (D) Western blotting.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about medical genetics.\n\nQ: The stage of meiosis in which chromosomes pair and cross over is:\n(A) prophase I (B) metaphase I (C) prophase II (D) metaphase II\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Prophase I is the stage of meiosis where homologous chromosomes pair with each other and exchange genetic material. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: DNA ligase is\n(A) an enzyme that joins fragments in normal DNA replication (B) an enzyme of bacterial origin which cuts DNA at defined base sequences (C) an enzyme that facilitates transcription of specific genes (D) an enzyme which limits the level to which a particular nutrient reaches\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. DNA ligase is a type of enzyme (EC 6.5.1.1) responsible for joining DNA strands together by catalyzing a phosphodiester bond. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?\n(A) Pyloric stenosis (B) Schizophrenia (C) Spina bifida (neural tube defects) (D) Marfan syndrome\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Multifactorial inheritance is when more than a single factor is responsible for causing a given trait or health problem. Genes cannot be the only factor. Marfan syndrome, on the other hand, requires only one abnormal copy of the of the Marfan gene, from one parent, to inherit the trait. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A gene showing codominance\n(A) has both alleles independently expressed in the heterozygote (B) has one allele dominant to the other (C) has alleles tightly linked on the same chromosome (D) has alleles expressed at the same time in development\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. Codominance, as it relates to genetics, refers to a type of genetic inheritance where the phenotype of both the parents is easily observed in the offspring. A heterozygote is an individual having two different alleles of a gene. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Large triplet repeat expansions can be detected by:\n(A) polymerase chain reaction. (B) single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. (C) Southern blotting. (D) Western blotting.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. A Southern blot is a method in molecular biology for detecting specific DNA sequences in a sample. Large triplet repeat expansions are usually detected with this method. The answer is (C).Q: If an autosomal recessive disorder which shows Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium has an incidence of 1 in 6400 then the frequency of carriers is approximately _______.\n(A) 1 in 20 (B) 1 in 40 (C) 1 in 80 (D) 1 in 160\nA: Let's think step by step.",
