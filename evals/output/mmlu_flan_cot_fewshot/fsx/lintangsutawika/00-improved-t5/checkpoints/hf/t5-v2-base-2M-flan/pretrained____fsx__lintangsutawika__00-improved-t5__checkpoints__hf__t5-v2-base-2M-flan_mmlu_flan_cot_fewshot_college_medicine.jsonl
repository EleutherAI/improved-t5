        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college medicine.\n\nQ: An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is:\n(A) muscle weakness. (B) gain in body mass. (C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body mass gain. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a true statement?\n(A) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A) \u201cMuscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(B) \u201cElite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(C) \u201cLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\u201d: This is a correct statement. \n(D) \u201cInsulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\u201d: This is not a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\u00b0C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201c(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201d is a correct statement. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:\n(A) via protein transporters called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin. (C) via hexokinase. (D) via monocarbylic acid transporters.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).Q: A student observes that mercury forms a convex meniscus in the graduated cylinder but that water forms a concave one. This behavior is best explained by the fact that:\n(A) the two liquids are being kept in graduated cylinders made of different materials.

(C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body mass gain. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a true statement?\n(A) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A) \u201cMuscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(B) \u201cElite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(C) \u201cLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\u201d: This is a correct statement. \n(D) \u201cInsulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\u201d: This is not a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\u00b0C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201c(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201d is a correct statement.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college medicine.\n\nQ: An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is:\n(A) muscle weakness. (B) gain in body mass. (C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body mass gain. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a true statement?\n(A) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A) \u201cMuscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(B) \u201cElite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(C) \u201cLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\u201d: This is a correct statement. \n(D) \u201cInsulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\u201d: This is not a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\u00b0C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201c(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201d is a correct statement. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:\n(A) via protein transporters called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin. (C) via hexokinase. (D) via monocarbylic acid transporters.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).Q: A psychology study run on a college campus was set up right outside of the gym on a weekday. Chocolate chip cookies were offered right outside the door, and then a sign was placed 15 feet further down the hall that asked people to avoid using the stairs, forcing them to go around in a longer hallway. There were no barriers to using the stairs other than the sign. The results returned, and it showed that individuals who took a sweet from the tray were twice as likely to use the longer hallway as individuals who refused. This is an example of what psychological concept?\n(A) Learned helplessness (B) Insecure attachment (C) Ego depletion (D) Tyranny of choice\nA: Let's think step by step.",

For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\u00b0C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201c(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201d is a correct statement. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:\n(A) via protein transporters called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin. (C) via hexokinase. (D) via monocarbylic acid transporters.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).Q: Which of the following would be the most accurate definition of Nietzsche\u2019s Will to Truth?\"\n(A) An intrinsic desire to know the truth.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?\n(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201c(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201d is a correct statement. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:\n(A) via protein transporters called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin. (C) via hexokinase. (D) via monocarbylic acid transporters.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).Q: During exercise, adrenaline secretion from the adrenal glands is stimulated by:\n(A) increased plasma glucose. (B) increased plasma fatty acids. (C) increased plasma ACTH. (D) increased sympathetic nerve activity.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college medicine.\n\nQ: An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is:\n(A) muscle weakness. (B) gain in body mass. (C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body mass gain. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a true statement?\n(A) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A) \u201cMuscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(B) \u201cElite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\u201d: This is a correct statement.\n(C) \u201cLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\u201d: This is a correct statement. \n(D) \u201cInsulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\u201d: This is not a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\u00b0C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase.
