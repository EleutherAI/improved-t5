        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\n\nQ: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\n(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nA: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nA: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II\nA: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: What are the mean and standard deviation of a binomial experiment that occurs with probability of success 0.76 and is repeated 150 times?\n(A) 114, 27.35 (B) 100.5, 5.23 (C) 114, 5.23 (D) The mean is 114, but there is not enough information given to determine the standard deviation.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II\nA: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: According to the central limit theorem, the sample mean X is approximately normally distributed\n(A) for a large sample, regardless of the distribution of random variable X (B) for a large sample, provided the random variable X is normally distributed (C) regardless of the sample size (D) for a small sample, regardless of the distribution of random variable X\nA: Let's think step by step.",

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water.

Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\n(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nA: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nA: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II\nA: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: Which of the following are examples of continuous data? I. The speed your car goes II. The number of outcomes of a binomial experiment III. The average temperature in San Francisco IV. The wingspan of a bird V.

The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: A random sample of families was taken in order to estimate the relation between fertility and level of education (measured in number of years). A confidence interval needs to be constructed for the slope of the regression line. The social worker in charge of the project is debating whether to use a 90 percent or a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements about the length of these intervals is true?\n(A) The 95 percent confidence interval will be wider than the 90 percent confidence interval. (B) The 95 percent confidence interval will be narrower than the 90 percent confidence interval. (C) Both intervals will be of the same length, because they are computed from the same sample. (D) The length of the confidence interval will depend on the sample size, not on the confidence level.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\n\nQ: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\n(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nA: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\n\nQ: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\n(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nA: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\n(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nA: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nA: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II\nA: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: A survey was conducted to determine the percentage of parents who would support raising the legal driving age to 18. The results were stated as 67% with a margin of error of \u00b13%. What is meant by \u00b13%?\n(A) Three percent of the population were not surveyed. (B) In the sample, the percentage of parents who would support raising the driving age is between 64% and 70%. (C) The percentage of the entire population of parents who would support raising the driving age is between 64% and 70%. (D) It is unlikely that the given sample proportion result could be obtained unless the true percentage was between 64% and 70%.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nA: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II\nA: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\n(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: Which of the following is a true statement?\n(A) While observational studies gather information on an already existing condition, they still often involve intentionally forcing some treatment to note the response. (B) In an experiment, researchers decide on the treatment but typically allow the subjects to self-select into the control group. (C) If properly designed, either observational studies or controlled experiments can easily be used to establish cause and effect. (D) Stratifying in sampling is the same idea as blocking for experiments.\nA: Let's think step by step.",
