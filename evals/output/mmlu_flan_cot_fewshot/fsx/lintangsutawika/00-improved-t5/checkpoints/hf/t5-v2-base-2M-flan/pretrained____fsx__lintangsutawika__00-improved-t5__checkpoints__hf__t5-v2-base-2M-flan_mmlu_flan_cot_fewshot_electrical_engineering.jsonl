        "\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about electrical engineering.\n\nQ: A point pole has a strength of 4\u03c0 * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4\u03c0 * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be\n(A) 15 N. (B) 20 N. (C) 7.5 N. (D) 3.75 N.\nA: Let's think step by step. The force between two point poles is given by m_1m_2/(mu_0 4 \\pi r^2), in analogy to Coulomb\u2019s law. Plugging in the values given in the question, we calculate that the force is approximately 15 N. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is\n(A) 1 mA. (B) 2 mA. (C) 3 mA. (D) 4 mA.\nA: Let's think step by step. The torque on a coil in a uniform magnetic field is given by BANI, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, N is the number of turns, and I is the current. So we have that I = (Torque)/(BAN), or 240e-6/(1200e-6 * 100 * 1) = 2e-3. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed\n(A) S=0, R=0 (B) S=0, R=1 (C) S=1, R=0 (D) S=1, R=1\nA: Let's think step by step. An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Two long parallel conductors carry 100 A. If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be\n(A) 100 N. (B) 0.1 N. (C) 1 N. (D) 0.01 N.\nA: Let's think step by step. The magnetic force-per-length between two current-carrying conductors is given by \\mu_0 I_1 I_2 / (2 \\pi r), where $r$ is the separation distance and I_1 and I_2 are the currents. Plugging in 100 A for I_1 and I_2, and 20 mm for r, gives 0.1 N. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2\u03a9 and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance\n(A) 200\u03a9 (B) 100\u03a9 (C) 50\u03a9 (D) 10\u03a9\nA: Let's think step by step. In lap winding, effectively two resistors are connected in parallel, so the actual resistance of each pair is 1 Ohm. Since we have 50 pairs, we get a total resistance of 50 Ohms. The answer is (C).Q: A 4 pole lap wound dc generator has 4 brushes, if one of the brush is damaged, what will be the change in V, I and P ratings\n(A) V, I and P (B) V/2, I/2 and P/4 (C) V/2, I and P/2 (D) V, I/2 and P/2\nA: Let's think step by step.",

The force in newtons on a point pole of 4\u03c0 * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be\n(A) 15 N. (B) 20 N. (C) 7.5 N. (D) 3.75 N.\nA: Let's think step by step. The force between two point poles is given by m_1m_2/(mu_0 4 \\pi r^2), in analogy to Coulomb\u2019s law. Plugging in the values given in the question, we calculate that the force is approximately 15 N. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is\n(A) 1 mA. (B) 2 mA. (C) 3 mA. (D) 4 mA.\nA: Let's think step by step. The torque on a coil in a uniform magnetic field is given by BANI, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, N is the number of turns, and I is the current. So we have that I = (Torque)/(BAN), or 240e-6/(1200e-6 * 100 * 1) = 2e-3. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed\n(A) S=0, R=0 (B) S=0, R=1 (C) S=1, R=0 (D) S=1, R=1\nA: Let's think step by step. An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Two long parallel conductors carry 100 A. If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be\n(A) 100 N. (B) 0.1 N. (C) 1 N. (D) 0.01 N.\nA: Let's think step by step.

Plugging in 100 A for I_1 and I_2, and 20 mm for r, gives 0.1 N.

The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed\n(A) S=0, R=0 (B) S=0, R=1 (C) S=1, R=0 (D) S=1, R=1\nA: Let's think step by step. An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Two long parallel conductors carry 100 A. If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be\n(A) 100 N. (B) 0.1 N. (C) 1 N. (D) 0.01 N.\nA: Let's think step by step. The magnetic force-per-length between two current-carrying conductors is given by \\mu_0 I_1 I_2 / (2 \\pi r), where $r$ is the separation distance and I_1 and I_2 are the currents. Plugging in 100 A for I_1 and I_2, and 20 mm for r, gives 0.1 N. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2\u03a9 and total number of conductors is 100.
