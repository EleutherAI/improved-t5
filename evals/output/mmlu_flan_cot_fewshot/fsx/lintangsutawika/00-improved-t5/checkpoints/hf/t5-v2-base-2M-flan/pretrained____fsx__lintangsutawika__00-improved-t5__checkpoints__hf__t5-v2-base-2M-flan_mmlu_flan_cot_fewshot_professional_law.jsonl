      "question": "When a buyer and a seller executed a valid contract for the sale of a house, the buyer gave the seller $1,000 as earnest money. The contract noted that the earnest money tendered would be applied to the purchase price at the time of sale but was silent as to remedies in the event of any default. Just before the closing, the buyer lost her job. The buyer told the seller that she could no longer purchase the house and asked him to return the earnest money. The seller accurately told the buyer that the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money; that if the seller sued the buyer for damages, he would receive a minimum of $5,000; and that it would be difficult for him to sell the house in the current market. Should the buyer get the earnest money back? ",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: Betty Buyer wanted to buy an antique Volvo automobile owned by Sarah Seller who had previously expressed some interest in selling.  Betty wrote Sarah a signed letter on April 1 stating \"I will buy your Volvo for $10,000 cash upon you bringing the vehicle to my home before April 5.

The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: Two defendants were prosecuted for conspiracy to rob a bank. An undercover officer of the local police department was the most important government witness. The defendants' principal defense was entrapment. The undercover officer testified for the government that he was present at a meeting with the defendants during which they plotted to rob the bank. He further testified that the idea of robbing the bank had first been suggested by one of the defendants, and that afterward, the undercover officer stated that he thought it was a good idea. Thereafter, the defendants' counsel called a witness who testified that the undercover officer had a bad reputation for truthfulness. The defense then called a second witness who proposed to testify that the undercover officer once perpetrated a hoax on the police department and was reprimanded. The second witness's proposed testimony is\n(A) admissible, because the hoax resulted in a reprimand of the undercover officer.  (B) admissible, because a hoax is probative of the undercover officer's untruthfulness.  (C) inadmissible, because it is essentially cumulative impeachment.  (D) inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of misconduct. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans.

      "question": "After riding the bus to and from her high school for two years, a girl decided that she was tired of relying on the bus and wanted her own mode of transportation. Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver's license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:\"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I've been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. \"The girl never made any further payment to the retailer.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

The woman accepted the husband's marriage proposal and planned a wedding. The day before the wedding, the husband decided not to go through with the ceremony. He told his wife about his relationship with the woman. He then asked her to tell the woman that they were married and he would no longer be seeing her. The husband knew that the woman had a manic depressive personality and was mentally unstable. When the wife broke the news to the woman, she had an emotional breakdown that required hospitalization. The woman sued the husband for breach of contract to marry and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The husband has filed motions to dismiss both causes of action. The court should\n(A) deny the motion to dismiss the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but grant the motion to dismiss the claim for breach of contract because it is against public policy to enforce marriage agreements.  (B) deny the motion to dismiss the claim for breach of contract to marry, but grant the motion to dismiss the action for infliction of emotional distress, because the husband's conduct was not extreme and outrageous.  (C) grant both motions to dismiss. (D) deny both motions, because the husband's conduct was extreme and outrageous and the court may grant relief for breach of contract, as well. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks.

The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law.

In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress.

In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

(C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument.

A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: An employer offered to pay a terminated employee $50,000 to release all claims the employee might have against the employer. The employee orally accepted the offer. The employer then prepared an unsigned release agreement and sent it to the employee for him to sign. The employee carefully prepared, signed, and sent to the employer a substitute release agreement that was identical to the original except that it excluded from the release any age discrimination claims. The employer signed the substitute release without reading it. Shortly thereafter, the employee notified the employer that he intended to sue the employer for age discrimination. Is the employer likely to prevail in an action seeking reformation of the release to conform to the parties' oral agreement?\n(A) No, because the employer acted unreasonably by failing to read the substitute release prior to signing it. (B) No, because the parol evidence rule will preclude evidence of the oral agreement. (C) Yes, because the employee's fraudulent behavior induced the employer's unilateral mistake. (D) Yes, because the parties were mutually mistaken regarding the contents of the signed release.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A seller sold his boat to a buyer. During negotiations, the buyer said that he planned to sail the boat on the open seas. The seller told the buyer that the boat was seaworthy and had never sustained any significant damage. In fact, the hull of the boat had been badly damaged when the seller had run the boat aground. The seller had then done a cosmetic repair to the hull rather than a structural repair. The buyer relied on the seller's representations and paid a fair price for a boat in good repair, only to discover after the sale was completed that the hull was in fact badly damaged and in a dangerous condition. The seller has refused to refund any of the buyer's money, and the buyer is contemplating suing the seller. Under what theory would the buyer be most likely to recover?\n(A) Fraud.

      "question": "A sportsman was the owner of an old dilapidated stadium, which was located on the outskirts of the city. The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home. The homeowner, who was sitting in the living room watching television, was struck by the flying glass and injured. If the homeowner asserts a claim for his injuries against the sportsman, which of the following is the sportsman's best defense?",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

      "question": "An individual investor purchased stock through a company's stock offering. When the price of the stock plummeted, the investor sued the company in a state court in State A, claiming that the company's offering materials had fraudulently induced him to purchase the stock and seeking $25,000 in damages. A university that had purchased the company's stock through the same offering sued the company in federal court in State B, claiming that the offering materials violated federal securities laws and seeking $1 million in damages. The individual investor's suit proceeded to trial. The state court ruled that the company's offering materials contained false information and awarded the investor a $25,000 judgment. The university immediately moved for partial summary judgment in its federal action against the company, arguing that the state court judgment bound the federal court on the issue of whether the company's offering materials contained false information. Neither State A nor State B permits nonmutual issue preclusion. Should the court grant the university's motion? ",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A man decided to give a cabin he owned to his daughter at his death. To accomplish this goal, he delivered to his attorney a deed that fully complied with the applicable statute of frauds and told his attorney to record the deed when he died unless he later gave the attorney instructions to the contrary. Three weeks after dropping off the deed, the man properly drafted and executed his own will, which left all of his real property to his son. One year later, the man died, and the attorney immediately recorded the deed. At the time of the man's death, the cabin was titled in his name and he owned no other real property.

The next day, the homeowner had an old friend from out of town arrive for a three-day visit. The homeowner had a spare room and loved to have overnight guests, so he had invited this old friend to come for a visit and was excited to see her. Shortly after the guest's arrival, however, the homeowner had to go to work for a few hours, so he told his friend to make herself comfortable in the house while he went to his office. While the homeowner was away from the house, his friend got hungry and made herself a snack. After finishing the snack, she realized that she had dropped a lot of crumbs on the carpet. Wanting to be a polite guest, she decided to clean up the mess herself before the homeowner returned. She saw the vacuum cleaner in the corner, plugged it in at an electric outlet, and started to vacuum up the crumbs, when she received a very strong electric shock as a result of the vacuum cleaner's faulty wiring. If the guest asserts a claim against the homeowner, the most likely result is that the guest will",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A homeowner purchased a new vacuum cleaner. A few days later, the homeowner received a severe electric shock while using the vacuum cleaner. The homeowner realized that there was a short in the wiring of the vacuum cleaner.

(B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

The answer is (D).Q: A security guard, dressed in plain clothes, was working for a discount store when a customer got into a heated argument with a cashier over the store's refund policy. Without identifying himself as a security guard, the security guard suddenly grabbed the customer's arm. The customer attempted to push the security guard away, and the security guard knocked the customer to the floor, causing injuries. The customer sued the discount store for battery on a theory of vicarious liability for the injuries caused by the security guard. The store filed an answer to the customer's complaint, asserting the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. The customer has moved to strike the affirmative defense. Traditional rules of contributory negligence apply. Should the trial court grant the customer's motion?\n(A) No, because contributory negligence is an affirmative defense to a cause of action based on vicarious liability. (B) No, because the customer should have known that his argument with the cashier might provoke an action by a security guard. (C) Yes, because contributory negligence is not a defense to battery. (D) Yes, because the customer did not know that he was pushing away someone who was employed as a security guard.  \u0080\u0083\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by.

The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

Several months after the contract was signed, the seller dismantled its machinery and stopped making bread crumbs. The buyer sued the seller. The seller testified and proved by expert evidence that it was no longer economically beneficial to produce bread crumbs. Will the court enforce the breach of contract action and award damages to the buyer?\n(A) Yes, an output contract must meet its output promises or the breaching party must pay reasonable damages. (B) Yes, the court will grant damages at least for the first year of operation so that the buyer recoups its initial losses. (C) No, the fact that the seller proved that it was economically unproductive means that the seller acted in good faith, and there was no further duty under the agreement. (D) No, the general promise of providing all of a company's output is considered an illusory promise that will not be enforced.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by.

(B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.

I'm too angry at our next-door neighbor. \" The husband had had an argument with his neighbor earlier that day. The husband then said, \"I've got this burning desire to go next door and beat him up. \" As the husband was about to walk out the door, he turned to his wife and said, \"You want to come along and watch?\" The wife nodded, as if to say okay, and followed him next door. Moments later, the husband rang the doorbell, and the neighbor came to the door. After entering the home, the husband grabbed the nei'ghbor and began punching him in the face. Terribly frightened, the neighbor pleaded with the husband to stop. As the husband continued to hit him, the neighbor turned to the wife and said, \"Please tell him to get off me. \" The wife, who despised the neighbor, simply stood by and told her husband, \"Do it, honey. . . do it. \" The husband punched the neighbor repeatedly and afterward threatened to kill him. On a charge of battery, the wife should be found\n(A) not guilty, because the wife's hands never made contact with the neighbor.  (B) not guilty, because the wife's mere presence and oral encouragement will not make her guilty as an accomplice.  (C) guilty, because, with the intent to have the neighbor beaten, she shouted encouragement to her husband.  (D) guilty, because she aided and abetted her husband through her mere presence, plus her intent to see the neighbor beaten. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans.

Although she was not present on the occasion in question, she will testify that, whenever she is home, the train always sounds its whistle before arriving at the crossing. Is the resident\u00d5s testimony admissible?\n(A) No, due to the resident\u00d5s lack of personal knowledge regarding the incident in question. (B) No, because habit evidence is limited to the conduct of persons, not businesses. (C) Yes, as evidence of a routine practice. (D) Yes, as a summary of her present sense impressions.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

The answer is (D).Q: On September 1, a man mailed a letter to a resort hotel on an island, reserving the \"honeymoon suite\" for the period from December 24 to January 1. The man explained that he and his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e were being married on December 23 and intended to travel by plane to the island on December 24. The resort hotel then sent back a confirmation notice stating that it was reserving the honeymoon suite for the man and his bride from December 24 to January 1 \"for the weekly rental of $10,000. \"On December 23, a blizzard struck, blanketing the city with five feet of snow. As a result, the airports were shut down. The man immediately telephoned the manager of the resort hotel and explained his predicament. When the manager requested assurance that the man and his bride would still be making the trip, the man responded, \"The airports are scheduled to re-open tomorrow . . . if they do we hope to make the trip. \" The next morning, the manager sent an e-mail to the man, advising him that the honeymoon suite had been rented to another couple for the period from December 24 to January 1. If the man brings suit against the resort hotel for breach of contract, which of the following will provide the hotel with its best defense'?'\n(A) The resort hotel's duty to hold the honeymoon suite for the man and his bride's arrival was excused by the apparent impossibility on December 23 of their timely performance. (B) The resort hotel's duty to hold the honeymoon suite for the man and his bride's arrival was discharged by their failure to give adequate assurances of their own agreed performance. (C) The resort hotel's duty to hold the honeymoon suite for the man and his bride's arrival was excused by frustration of purpose. (D) The man and his bride's apparent inability on December 23 to make the trip constituted a material breach that excused the resort hotel of any obligation to hold the honeymoon suite for their arrival.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property.

Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step.

      "question": "A man owned a house where he lived with his family. The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument.

A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step.

(C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step.

A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step.

The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: Under which of the following fact situations would the defendant's Miranda waiver most likely be ineffective?\n(A) A defendant recently graduated from law school. At her graduation party, the defendant became highly intoxicated after drinking a pint of whiskey. Following the party, the defendant attempted to drive home in her car. She fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into another vehicle, seriously injuring the driver. Shortly after the accident, a police officer came on the scene and arrested the defendant, charging her with D. U. I. The defendant was then given her Miranda warnings and transported to the police station. Upon questioning, the defendant, who was still highly intoxicated, waived her Miranda rights, and the police elicited an incriminating statement.  (B) A defendant stabbed a victim after a violent argument. Following the stabbing death, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with murder. He was transported to the station house where Miranda warnings were given. Afterward, the defendant was interrogated and proceeded to waive his Miranda rights. He then confessed to committing the crime. At trial, a psychiatrist testified that the defendant was mentally ill and his confession was not the result of a knowing and intelligent waiver.  (C) A defendant was a 15-year-old boy who was a high school sophomore. He possessed normal intelligence and experience for a youth of his age. One night he and two friends attended a concert in the park. After the concert, the defendant and his friends went on a spree, assaulting and robbing a number of victims in the park. The next day, the defendant was arrested. After being subjected to persistent questioning for two hours, the defendant waived his Miranda rights and made a confession. At trial, the defendant claims that he did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver.  (D) A defendant was a 16-year-old juvenile who was in police custody on suspicion of murder. He was given his Miranda warnings and he then requested to have his probation officer present. He had been on probation for a series of juvenile offenses. His request was denied. During a brief interrogation, the defendant proceeded to waive his Miranda rights and made incriminating statements that linked him with the crime. At trial, the defendant's lawyer claims that his waiver was ineffective because his request to see the probation officer was the equivalent of asking for a lawyer. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A hardware store had a public pay telephone attached to the outside wall of its building. The telephone was owned and operated by the local telephone company. On Thursday, November 25, the store was closed for Thanksgiving. A resident, who lived two doors away, walked to the hardware store to use the telephone. He wanted to call his son and daughter- in-law to wish them a happy Thanksgiving, but his home phone was out of order. The resident picked up the receiver, inserted coins for the cost of the call, and promptly received an electric shock. Although the resident was momentarily stunned, he did not suffer any pain or injuries. Unbeknownst to the resident, a technician employed by the telephone company had incorrectly rewired the telephone the previous day, causing a short circuit in the telephone mechanism. If the resident institutes a personal injury action for negligence against the telephone company, he will most likely\n(A) recover, because the technician's error would constitute the proximate cause of the resident's injuries.  (B) recover, because the technician's error was a substantial factor in causing the resident's injuries.  (C) recover, under the doctrine of respondeat superior (D) not recover, because the resident did not suffer any injuries. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A man is suing a store for damages for injuries allegedly suffered when a can of soup fell on his toe while he was shopping. At trial, the store calls a member of the local community to testif' that the man's reputation for honesty is poor, and that he is known far and wide as the biggest storyteller intown. This testimony is\n(A) admissible, but only to show the likely exaggeration of the man's alleged injuries.  (B) admissible, but only to discredit the man's testimony that the accident happened in the manner in which he claims it did.  (C) inadmissible character evidence. (D) inadmissible, because the man's testimony has not yet been rebutted by the store, and his credibility is, therefore, not yet susceptible to attack. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A woman awoke one morning to discover that someone had vandalized her home during the night. The woman then published the following notice in the local newspaper:\"REWARDAny person who supplies information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who vandalized my home, located at 1223 1st Street, will be paid $5,000. \"The reward notice in the local newspaper proposed a\n(A) unilateral contract only. (B) bilateral contract only. (C) unilateral contract or bilateral contract, at the offeree's option.  (D) unilateral contract that ripened into a bilateral contract when someone supplied the information leading to the vandal's conviction.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A man decided to steal a valuable coin collection from a collector's house while the collector was away. Knowing that the house had an alarm system, the man contacted the pool cleaner who worked at the house twice a week. The man offered the pool cleaner part of the proceeds from selling the coin collection if she would disarm the alarm and leave a side door unlocked so that the man could enter the house. The pool cleaner pretended to agree but then contacted the police, who immediately arrested then contacted the police, who immediately arrested the man. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law and has adopted the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, what crime has the man committed?\n(A) Attempted burglary. (B) Attempted larceny. (C) Conspiracy. (D) Solicitation.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument.

A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The patient told the doctor she would agree to the operation only if any blood given to her during the operation came from the blood donated by her family. When the doctor performed the surgery, he requisitioned blood from the hospital's blood bank for the patient's transfusion instead of using her family's donated blood. It was the customary practice of doctors in the community to use blood from the hospital's blood bank during surgery. ft was later determined that the hospital blood given to the patient was tainted with HIV. The hospital had not properly screened the blood for the presence of the HIV virus. The patient did not contract the HIV virus. If the patient asserts an action against the doctor for battery, she will\n(A) prevail, because consent to the operation was based upon the use of her family's blood.  (B) prevail, because the hospital failed to properly screen the blood to detect its contamination.  (C) not prevail, because the patient did not contract the HIV virus.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A private developer sought a building permit to build a nursing home in a district that was zoned \"residential\" by the township. The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home?\n(A) Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate. (B) No, it is strictly a matter of local preference whether a particular use will be allowed in a zoning district. (C) No, because there are numerous other locations for nursing homes within the state, a local community's restriction against that use is not discriminatory. (D) Yes, the zoning law represents an unconstitutional denial of substantive due process to handicapped persons.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A boyfriend was unhappy in his relationship with his girlfriend. When the girlfriend got drunk, she would become abusive and beat her boyfriend. During the course of their relationship, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the boyfriend hired a hit man to kill his girlfriend. One night while the girlfriend was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the boyfriend and shot the girlfriend to death. Afterward, the boyfriend was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. The defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the boyfriend acted in self-defense. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n(A) No, because the boyfriend's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.  (B) No, because the boyfriend could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.  (C) Yes, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the boyfriend acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect himself from the girlfriend's constant violent attacks.  (D) Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property. Based on this information, the police retrieved the stolen property, which included a diamond necklace. Later the same day, the police went to the defendant's jail cell and showed him the diamond necklace that they had recovered. They also told the defendant that the co-conspirator had confessed and implicated him in the perpetration of the crime. Confronted by this evidence, the defendant confessed.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A defendant and his co-conspirator were arrested and charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property. Based on this information, the police retrieved the stolen property, which included a diamond necklace. Later the same day, the police went to the defendant's jail cell and showed him the diamond necklace that they had recovered. They also told the defendant that the co-conspirator had confessed and implicated him in the perpetration of the crime. Confronted by this evidence, the defendant confessed. The defendant was then prosecuted for conspiracy and robbery. At the defendant's trial, the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence the necklace and the defendant's confession. The defendant's motion to exclude these offers of proof will be\n(A) denied to both the necklace and the confession. (B) denied to the necklace, but granted to the confession.  (C) granted to the necklace, but denied to the confession.  (D) granted to both the necklace and the confession.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

      "question": "A developer acquired a large parcel that he intended to convert into a residential subdivision. The developer met with the man who owned the adjoining property and informed him of the proposed development plans. During their discussion, the man expressed concern about the increased traffic and noise from the subdivision. Thus, the parties orally agreed that the developer would contract with someone to erect a brick wall between their respective properties, and that the man would reimburse the developer for half the expenses the developer incurred in having the wall erected. Thereafter, the developer hired a mason to erect the wall for $10,000. The developer explained to the mason that the wall was being built between his property and the man's. He further advised the mason that although he (the developer) would be paying the mason the $10,000, the man had agreed to reimburse the developer for half the price. The mason built the wall as agreed. However, the developer refused to pay the mason anything, and the mason, in turn, did not sue the developer for the agreed price.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A developer acquired a large parcel that he intended to convert into a residential subdivision. The developer met with the man who owned the adjoining property and informed him of the proposed development plans. During their discussion, the man expressed concern about the increased traffic and noise from the subdivision. Thus, the parties orally agreed that the developer would contract with someone to erect a brick wall between their respective properties, and that the man would reimburse the developer for half the expenses the developer incurred in having the wall erected. Thereafter, the developer hired a mason to erect the wall for $10,000. The developer explained to the mason that the wall was being built between his property and the man's.

      "question": "One fall weekend, an outdoorsman went on a camping trip to a remote wilderness area deep in the northern part of the state in which he lived. While on the trip, the outdoorsman went deer hunting. He was in a very desolate area, surrounded by a densely wooded terrain, that was located at least 100 miles from any habitation. After a rather uneventful morning with nothing at which to shoot, the outdoorsman suddenly spotted a bald eagle; a nearly extinct bird.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The chair struck the pedestrian on the head, knocking her unconscious. When the pedestrian recovered consciousness, she found herself in a nearby hospital with a doctor in attendance. An examination revealed that the pedestrian had suffered a concussion and severe head lacerations. A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the hotel for negligence, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur enable her to recover?\n(A) Yes, because the chair was within the control of the hotel.  (B) Yes, because a chair is not usually thrown from a window in the absence of someone's negligence.  (C) No, because the chair was not within the control of the hotel at the time the pedestrian was injured.  (D) No, because the hotel is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its employees. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree.

      "question": "A homeowner owned a single-story ranch- style home that was her primary residence. The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?",

(B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A homeowner owned a single-story ranch- style home that was her primary residence. The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?\n(A) The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  (B) Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  (C) The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  (D) Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A small electronics corporation decided to radically overhaul its manufacturing processes and borrowed $200,000 from the bank for this purpose. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the corporation's plant and building site. When the debt came due, the corporation was short of ready cash and the bank threatened to foreclose. One of the shareholders of the corporation then intervened on behalf of the corporation and told the bank officials that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, she would personally see that the debt was paid. The bank orally agreed to the shareholder's arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. The bank's promise to the shareholder to refrain from foreclosing on the mortgage would constitute\n(A) a void promise at the time of inception. (B) a voidable promise as violative of the statute of frauds. (C) an unenforceable promise, because the corporation had a pre-existing duty to pay the debt at maturity.  (D) an enforceable promise, binding the shareholder as a surety. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A man has sued a police officer, alleging that the officer violated the man's civil rights by using excessive force while arresting him. At trial, the officer admits having hit the man in the head with the butt of his gun, but contends that the force was necessary, because the man was resisting arrest. In support of his contention, the officer seeks to introduce evidence that the man had resisted arrest on three prior occasions during the last 10 years. Is this testimony regarding the man's conduct during the three prior arrests admissible?\n(A) No, because evidence of the prior incidents constitutes impermissible character evidence. (B) No, because the officer has not shown that the man was convicted in connection with the prior incidents. (C) Yes, because the incidents in question are relevant evidence of the man's propensity for violence. (D) Yes, because the incidents in question are sufficient to constitute a habit.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

      "question": "A state resident could purchase a license solely for hunting elk for $9. 00. A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A state resident could purchase a license solely for hunting elk for $9. 00. A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098. Vhereas the interest of resident hunters more often may be in the meat, among nonresident hunters, big-game hunting is clearly a sport in the state. Two residents of another state bring suit against the state. They assert in their complaint that the disparities between residents and nonresidents in the state hunting license system is unconstitutional. The state's hunting license system should be found\n(A) constitutional, because it is within the police power of a state to regulate a recreational, noncommercial activity.  (B) constitutional, because there is a compelling state interest.  (C) unconstitutional, because it violates the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

      "question": "A president of a small computer company decided to expand his operation. On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position. Soon after the new technological development took place, the company's business fortunes declined, which resulted in the company's insolvency.

      "question": "A collector had an extensive collection of sports memorabilia, which included baseball cards, autographed bats, balls, and old uniforms. The collector would often attend regional shows where he would display his vast collection and meet with other sports enthusiasts. One day at a sports memorabilia show, the defendant approached the collector with an old baseball glove with what appeared to be an authentic signature of a famous player. Unknown to the collector, the defendant signed the glove himself.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A collector had an extensive collection of sports memorabilia, which included baseball cards, autographed bats, balls, and old uniforms. The collector would often attend regional shows where he would display his vast collection and meet with other sports enthusiasts. One day at a sports memorabilia show, the defendant approached the collector with an old baseball glove with what appeared to be an authentic signature of a famous player. Unknown to the collector, the defendant signed the glove himself. The defendant had practiced the distinctive signature of the famous player for several hours before signing the glove with an extremely good likeness of his signature. The collector examined the glove and asked the defendant if the signature was authentic. The defendant replied that he had purchased the glove at an auction and could not vouch for the authenticity of the signature. The collector paid the defendant for the glove. Later, the collector took the glove to a handwriting expert who informed the collector that the signature on the glove was a very skillful fake, but a fake, nonetheless. The defendant is guilty of\n(A) false pretenses but not forgery, because the glove is not a document with legalsignificance.

      "question": "Many years ago, a nuclear power plant had been accused of poisoning local oyster beds with waste. The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

While at the game, he became involved in an altercation with a fan of the visiting team. When the fan cheered for a home team goal, the visiting fan turned around and threatened to kill the home fan if he didn't shut up. The home fan pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed the visiting fan in the arm. At his trial for aggravated assault, the home fan wants to introduce a statement from a witness who was standing next to the visiting fan at the game. The statement, which the witness had made earlier in the game when the home fan cheered for the home team, was, \"You'd better watch out. At a hockey game last week, the visiting fan put two guys in the hospital when they wouldn't shut up. One of them had 33 stitches after the visiting fan bashed his head against the steps. \"Assume that the witness's statement is offered as proof of the effect it produced in the home fan's mind. In this regard, the statement would most likely be\n(A) admissible as non-hearsay. (B) admissible as a present sense impression. (C) inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. (D) inadmissible, because the statement is selfserving. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

      "question": "In light of the current oil glut, many oil producing states have experienced extreme economic hardship. Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional?",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: Aman had just won $14,000,000 in the lottery.

The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: After drinking for many hours, a very drunk man encountered another man in a convenience store and asked him for five dollars. The customer refused, and the drunk man knocked him down and began beating his head against the floor. The drunk man woke up hours later in jail, with no memory of the events. The police charged him with aggravated assault, which required proof of specific intent. At trial, the drunk man asked for an additional jury charge of simple assault, which did not require specific intent. The trial court refused, and the drunk man was convicted of aggravated assault. On appeal, will the appeals court likely reverse for a new trial, ordering that a charge on simple assault be added?\n(A) Yes, because the lesser included crime must always be a part of the jury charge in order to allow the jury to pick and choose whichever crime it feels applies. (B) Yes, because the evidence of voluntary intoxication could rule out a finding of specific intent, and therefore the jury should have the choice of each crime before it. (C) No, because voluntary intoxication is no defense to crime. (D) No, because the violent force of beating his head on the ground would preclude a simple assault charge as a matter of law.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.

Situated along the north shore of this island were coral reefs which are the home of a very rare species of fish that are found only along the north shore area. Congress conducted hearings to decide whether to authorize the construction of the naval base. During the hearings, one of the speakers who addressed the congressional committee was a famous expert on oceanography and marine biology.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest.

(B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.

Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A man was injured when his kitchen oven exploded due to a manufacturing defect. He filed a complaint against the oven manufacturer for personal injury damages. He also added a count for class certification and requested a recall of all similar ovens sold to consumers to stop the danger of physical injury. He created two putative classes: (1) everyone who purchased that model oven who lived in New York, the state where the man resided; and (2) everyone who purchased that model oven who resided in 25 other designated states where the company did business. The manufacturer filed a motion to dismiss the second putative class preliminarily under Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which allows for the early striking of any immaterial matter from the complaint. Will the federal district court judge likely grant the motion?\n(A) Yes, the court will grant it because the plaintiff is not a member of the second class that he set up. (B) Yes, the court will grant it because the plaintiff has not specifically listed the identity of each member of the second putative class. (C) No, the court will not grant it because it is too early to decide class certification issues and it can't be done through Rule 12(f) of the FRCP. (D) No, the court will not grant it because the plaintiff does not have to be a member of the exact class in order to represent that class.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A homeowner owns a home in fee simple and leased it to his cousin for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the cousin expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the cousin, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The cousin and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the cousin, still owing the homeowner three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a friend, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the friend would pay the homeowner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. After the cousin's assignment to the friend, the homeowner sues the cousin to recover the rent in arrears. The homeowner will most likely\n(A) succeed, because the homeowner and the cousin stood in privity of contract.  (B) succeed, even though the homeowner had notice of the assignment.  (C) not succeed, because the cousin had assigned his interest in the premises before the homeowner brought suit.  (D) not succeed, because he did not object to the assignment. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The rope became tangled around the boy's foot, causing him to suffer severe injuries. In a suit brought on the boy's behalf against the girl, the boy has introduced uncontroverted evidence that the girl drove carelessly in such a way as to entangle the boy in the rope. Is the boy likely to prevail?\n(A) No, because the boy assumed the risk. (B) No, because the girl was too young to be expected to appreciate and avoid the risk she expected to appreciate and avoid the risk she exposed the boy to. (C) Yes, because children of the girl's age should have the capacity to operate motorboats. (D) Yes, because the girl will be held to an adult standard of care.  \u0080\u0083\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree.

In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\n(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. (B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. (C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. (D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\n(A) Indisputable facts. (B) Facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations. (C) Facts recognized to be true by common knowledge. (D) Facts capable of scientific verification.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. Among the options, facts that have been asserted by individual political organizations is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\n(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. (B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. (C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. (D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The answer is (D).Q: A buyer signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a developer. The contract was signed on May 1, 2008, and the closing was set for June 15, 2008. The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations \u0080\u0094\"an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty (20) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. \"This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1932. The land in question had been owned by a doctor in 1962. On September 1, 1962, the doctor died intestate. The doctor's administratrix conveyed the tract to the developer on November 1, 1962, which the latter recorded on the same date. During her title search, the buyer learned that the administratrix had never obtained any license to sell the land in question. The buyer also learned that the administratrix never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the doctor's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the developer entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1962. The developer was ousted from the land in question by a woman on October 1, 1982. The developer then recovered possession of the land from the woman in an action of ejectment on December 31, 1982. The buyer should be advised that the developer became the owner of the land in question on\n(A) November 1, 1962.  (B) November 1, 1982.  (C) December 31, 1982.  (D) December 31, 2002. \nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional law.\n\nQ: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\n(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. (B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. (C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. (D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\n(A) The commerce clause. (B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (C) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. (D) The contract clause.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The commerce clause states that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. The statute affects inter-state commerce which puts it into question. Hence the man's strongest argument should be the commerce clause. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property.
