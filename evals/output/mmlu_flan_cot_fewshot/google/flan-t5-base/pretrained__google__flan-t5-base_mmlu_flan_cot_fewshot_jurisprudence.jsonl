(C) The letter contains a valid offer which will terminate within a reasonable time. (D) The letter lacks one of the essential elements of an offer.\nA: Let's think step by step.

Natural Law School of jurisprudence focuses on the laws of nature, and states that the law should be based on ethics, morals, and what is \"correct\".

(D) Capitalism.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Weber explained the development of formal rationality in laws as how the modern society moved from tradition to rationality, where people decide actions based less on how they were culturally done and more on expected utilities.
