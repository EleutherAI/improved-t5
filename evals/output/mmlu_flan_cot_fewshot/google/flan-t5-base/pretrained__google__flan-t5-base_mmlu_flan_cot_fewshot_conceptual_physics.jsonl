        "\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about conceptual physics.\n\nQ: Colors in a soap bubble result from light\n(A) converted to a different frequency (B) deflection (C) interference (D) polarization\nA: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Compared with the mass of a uranium atom undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are\n(A) less (B) more (C) the same (D) zero\nA: Let's think step by step. Fission releases energy, which comes from the rest mass of its initial nucleus. Thus the mass of the products is less than the mass of the reactant uranium nucleus. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Things that are equivalent according to the equivalence principle are\n(A) space and time. (B) a traveling twin and a stay-at-home twin. (C) gravity and acceleration. (D) mass and energy.\nA: Let's think step by step. Einstein\u2019s famous equivalence principle states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of these three elements has the most mass per nucleon?\n(A) Hydrogen (B) Iron (C) Uranium (D) Same in each\nA: Let's think step by step. Due to nuclear binding energy, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons; this is known as the mass defect. Hydrogen has no mass defect because it has only a single nucleon, so it will have the most mass per nucleon. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is\n(A) the same (B) greater (C) less (D) either greater or less depending on wind speed\nA: Let's think step by step. The plane\u2019s speed in the direction of the wind is greater than it would be in the absence of wind, and its direction orthogonal to the wind is the same as it would be in the absence of the wind. The total speed, which is these two components added in quadrature, is thus greater than the speed in still air.

        "\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about conceptual physics.\n\nQ: Colors in a soap bubble result from light\n(A) converted to a different frequency (B) deflection (C) interference (D) polarization\nA: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Compared with the mass of a uranium atom undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are\n(A) less (B) more (C) the same (D) zero\nA: Let's think step by step. Fission releases energy, which comes from the rest mass of its initial nucleus. Thus the mass of the products is less than the mass of the reactant uranium nucleus. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Things that are equivalent according to the equivalence principle are\n(A) space and time. (B) a traveling twin and a stay-at-home twin. (C) gravity and acceleration. (D) mass and energy.\nA: Let's think step by step. Einstein\u2019s famous equivalence principle states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of these three elements has the most mass per nucleon?\n(A) Hydrogen (B) Iron (C) Uranium (D) Same in each\nA: Let's think step by step. Due to nuclear binding energy, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons; this is known as the mass defect. Hydrogen has no mass defect because it has only a single nucleon, so it will have the most mass per nucleon. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is\n(A) the same (B) greater (C) less (D) either greater or less depending on wind speed\nA: Let's think step by step. The plane\u2019s speed in the direction of the wind is greater than it would be in the absence of wind, and its direction orthogonal to the wind is the same as it would be in the absence of the wind. The total speed, which is these two components added in quadrature, is thus greater than the speed in still air.

        "\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about conceptual physics.\n\nQ: Colors in a soap bubble result from light\n(A) converted to a different frequency (B) deflection (C) interference (D) polarization\nA: Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Compared with the mass of a uranium atom undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are\n(A) less (B) more (C) the same (D) zero\nA: Let's think step by step. Fission releases energy, which comes from the rest mass of its initial nucleus. Thus the mass of the products is less than the mass of the reactant uranium nucleus. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Things that are equivalent according to the equivalence principle are\n(A) space and time. (B) a traveling twin and a stay-at-home twin. (C) gravity and acceleration. (D) mass and energy.\nA: Let's think step by step. Einstein\u2019s famous equivalence principle states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of these three elements has the most mass per nucleon?\n(A) Hydrogen (B) Iron (C) Uranium (D) Same in each\nA: Let's think step by step. Due to nuclear binding energy, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons; this is known as the mass defect. Hydrogen has no mass defect because it has only a single nucleon, so it will have the most mass per nucleon. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is\n(A) the same (B) greater (C) less (D) either greater or less depending on wind speed\nA: Let's think step by step. The plane\u2019s speed in the direction of the wind is greater than it would be in the absence of wind, and its direction orthogonal to the wind is the same as it would be in the absence of the wind. The total speed, which is these two components added in quadrature, is thus greater than the speed in still air.
