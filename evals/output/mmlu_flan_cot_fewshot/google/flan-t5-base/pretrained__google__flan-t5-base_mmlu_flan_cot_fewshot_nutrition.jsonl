        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about nutrition.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size. The answer is (C).Q: Which of the following statements about plasma lipoproteins is correct?\n(A) They have a hydrophobic core of triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters (B) They have a hydrophobic core of phospholipids and free cholesterol (C) They have a hydrophilic core of triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters (D) They have a hydrophobic core of phospholipid and apolipoproteins\nA: Let's think step by step.",

We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about nutrition.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size. The answer is (C).Q: It is true about Bulimia Nervosa that:\n(A) Patients usually have a BMI<17.5 kg/m2 (B) It has an equal gender distribution (C) Some patients have purging without binge eating episodes (D) Self-induced vomiting is the most frequent compensatory behaviour\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about nutrition.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about nutrition.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about nutrition.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame (B) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin (C) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose (D) Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n(A) 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI (B) Dairy products are a poor source of iodine (C) The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk (D) UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Organic milk usually has less iodine content than non-organic milk. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\n(A) Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis (B) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene (C) None of these options are correct (D) Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Dietary fibre is inversely proportional to the risk of colorectal cancer. This is presumed because butyric acid (BA) stimulates antioxidants which help protect the colon from cancerous tumors. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a cohort study, the risk ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 when comparing consumers of tea (the exposed) to those who did not drink tea (the unexposed). Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\n(A) The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes. (B) The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes. (C) Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance. (D) The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. The risk ratio is not sufficiently reduced that it could not be explained by random chance given the studies sample size. The answer is (C).Q: Which of the following is a function of vitamin B12?\n(A) Synthesis of TMP (thymidine monophosphate) (B) Decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters (C) Synthesis of methionine from homocysteine (D) Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate\nA: Let's think step by step.",
