We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\nUsing equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B).Q: Sometimes the object module produced by a compiler includes information (from the symbol table) mapping all source program names to their addresses. The most likely purpose of this information is\n(A) for use as input to a debugging aid (B) to increase the run-time efficiency of the program (C) for the reduction of the symbol-table space needed by the compiler (D) to tell the loader where each variable belongs\nA: Let's think step by step.",

Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B).Q: Consider the following possible data structures for a set of n distinct integers.\nI. A min-heap\nII. An array of length n sorted in increasing order\nIII. A balanced binary search tree\nFor which of these data structures is the number of steps needed to find and remove the 7th largest element O(log n) in the worst case?\n(A) I only (B) II only (C) I and II (D) II and III\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?\n(A) a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)\n(B) a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*\n(C) a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d)\n(D) (a + b)*c +(a + b)*d\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\nUsing equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27.

We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\nUsing equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B).Q: Church's thesis equates the concept of \"computable function\" with those functions computable by, for example, Turing machines. Which of the following is true of Church's thesis?\n(A) It was first proven by Alan Turing. (B) It has not yet been proven, but finding a proof is a subject of active research. (C) It can never be proven. (D) It is now in doubt because of the advent of parallel computers.\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?\n(A) a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)\n(B) a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*\n(C) a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d)\n(D) (a + b)*c +(a + b)*d\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\nUsing equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B).Q: Suppose it takes 1 second to factor a general 100 x 100 matrix using Gaussian elimination. Of the following, which is the best estimate of the number of seconds it will take to factor a 500 x 500 matrix based on the relative dimensions?\n(A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 25 (D) 125\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?\n(A) a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)\n(B) a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*\n(C) a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d)\n(D) (a + b)*c +(a + b)*d\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\nUsing equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) III only\n(D) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.\nGiven these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.\nNext, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.\nNext, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.\nWe can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:\ncompute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3\ncompute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4\ncompute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5\ncompute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6\nSTALL\ncompute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7\nSo there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is\n(A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:\n1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)\n2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)\n3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)\n4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)\n5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)\n6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)\n7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)\n8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\n9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)\nThis sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?\n(A) 1/50 (B) 1/27 (C) 1/25 (D) 2/27\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.\nThus a given processor has:\n(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =\n(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:\nmisses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.\nNext, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:\n50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:\ninstructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.\nNow, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:\nlock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.\nThus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:\nlock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =\n(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B).Q: The main difference between a network operating system and a distributed operating system is that\n(A) A network operating system hides the existence of many machines from the user, but a distributed operating system makes the existence of many machines visible (B) A distributed operating system hides the existence of many machines from the user, but a network operating system makes the existence of many machines visible (C) A network operating system uses a local-area network, while a distributed operating system uses a wide-area network (D) A distributed operating system uses a local-area network, while a network operating system uses a wide-area network\nA: Let's think step by step.",
