        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional psychology.\n\nQ: In the construction of a multiple regression equation for purposes of prediction, the optimal combination of measures is one in which the predictors\n(A) are uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion (B) have low correlations with each other and low correlations with the criterion (C) are highly intercorrelated with each other and moderately correlated with the criterion (D) have low correlations with the criterion bur are moderately correlated with each other\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess the relationship between one continuous variable and a set of independent variables. So the predictors should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: There are three ways to measure the Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median and the Mode. From your knowledge about them, what is the mode?\n(A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B) more useful for skewed distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly skewed distributions (D) the most frequently occurring number\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The definition of mode is the most frequently occurring number. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Carl Jung believed that a client's transference:\n(A) is a fantasy that distracts the client from reality. (B) represents \u201cmixed feelings\u201d toward the therapist. (C) \"is a form of \"\"acting out.\"\"\" (D) reflects the client\u2019s personal and collective unconscious.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Transference is a phenomenon that a person's feelings are unconsciously redirected, so it reflects the client's personal and collective unconscious. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In terms of Hofstede\u2019s (1980) five cultural dimensions, the United States scores at the top of the scale on:\n(A) individualism. (B) individualism and power distance. (C) power distance and masculinity. (D) uncertainty avoidance.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. US scores highest on individualism among the five cultural dimensions. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: One of your therapy clients asks your advice about a good weight- reduction program. You have investigated the programs in the community and are enrolled in the one you consider the best. This program offers a $50 bonus to its patrons for each new person they bring into the program. Under these circumstances, your most appropriate response would be to\n(A) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know about except for the one in which you are enrolled (B) recommend to your client the program in which you are enrolled and explain the $50 bonus you will receive (C) recommend to your client the program in which you are enrolled and offer to have the $50 bonus credited to your client's account in the program (D) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know about, but do not claim the $50 bonus if your client enrolls in your program\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Based on the circumstances, you should tell your client about the pros and cons of each program, but it would be inappropriate to receive the bonus, so you should not claim the $50 bonus. The answer is (D).Q: A psychology professor is sexually attracted to psychology graduate student enrolled in a class taught by the professor. The student has returned for graduate work in psychology after 10 years of managing a successful accounting firm. The student suggests to the professor that they attend the opera together. Since they are approximately the same age and both enjoy music, the professor accepts the invitation. For the professor, accepting the invitation is\n(A) ethical, bur shows poor judgment because there could be a controversy about the student\u2019s grade later in the term (B) unethical, because it establishes a dual relationship (C) ethical, as long as their relationship does not interfere with the professor's job or the treatment of other students (D) a matter of personal preference, being of no intrinsic difference from accepting any other invitation\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional psychology.\n\nQ: In the construction of a multiple regression equation for purposes of prediction, the optimal combination of measures is one in which the predictors\n(A) are uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion (B) have low correlations with each other and low correlations with the criterion (C) are highly intercorrelated with each other and moderately correlated with the criterion (D) have low correlations with the criterion bur are moderately correlated with each other\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess the relationship between one continuous variable and a set of independent variables. So the predictors should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: There are three ways to measure the Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median and the Mode. From your knowledge about them, what is the mode?\n(A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B) more useful for skewed distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly skewed distributions (D) the most frequently occurring number\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The definition of mode is the most frequently occurring number. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Carl Jung believed that a client's transference:\n(A) is a fantasy that distracts the client from reality. (B) represents \u201cmixed feelings\u201d toward the therapist. (C) \"is a form of \"\"acting out.\"\"\" (D) reflects the client\u2019s personal and collective unconscious.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Transference is a phenomenon that a person's feelings are unconsciously redirected, so it reflects the client's personal and collective unconscious. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In terms of Hofstede\u2019s (1980) five cultural dimensions, the United States scores at the top of the scale on:\n(A) individualism. (B) individualism and power distance. (C) power distance and masculinity. (D) uncertainty avoidance.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. US scores highest on individualism among the five cultural dimensions. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: One of your therapy clients asks your advice about a good weight- reduction program. You have investigated the programs in the community and are enrolled in the one you consider the best. This program offers a $50 bonus to its patrons for each new person they bring into the program. Under these circumstances, your most appropriate response would be to\n(A) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know about except for the one in which you are enrolled (B) recommend to your client the program in which you are enrolled and explain the $50 bonus you will receive (C) recommend to your client the program in which you are enrolled and offer to have the $50 bonus credited to your client's account in the program (D) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know about, but do not claim the $50 bonus if your client enrolls in your program\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Based on the circumstances, you should tell your client about the pros and cons of each program, but it would be inappropriate to receive the bonus, so you should not claim the $50 bonus. The answer is (D).Q: Admission assessment findings on a psychiatric inpatient include 2 3- week history of the following: severe feelings of worthlessness, irritability, and agitation; poor appetite and weight loss; insomnia; and inability to concentrate. The patient expresses a belief the hospital admission is a punishment for times committed by the patient against family members.

We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess the relationship between one continuous variable and a set of independent variables. So the predictors should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: There are three ways to measure the Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median and the Mode. From your knowledge about them, what is the mode?\n(A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B) more useful for skewed distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly skewed distributions (D) the most frequently occurring number\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The definition of mode is the most frequently occurring number.

We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess the relationship between one continuous variable and a set of independent variables. So the predictors should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the criterion. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: There are three ways to measure the Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median and the Mode. From your knowledge about them, what is the mode?\n(A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B) more useful for skewed distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly skewed distributions (D) the most frequently occurring number\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The definition of mode is the most frequently occurring number. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Carl Jung believed that a client's transference:\n(A) is a fantasy that distracts the client from reality. (B) represents \u201cmixed feelings\u201d toward the therapist.
