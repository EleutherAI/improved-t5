We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help. Ignorance of refutation, one of Aristotle's original list of logical fallacies in his Organon, is when someone causes confusion in an argument through real or feigned inability to engage in refutation, in order to win the argument. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The complex question fallacy consists of\n(A) arguing something is inferior just because it doesn't do something it was never intended to do. (B) including more than one claim in the proposition and treating proof for one claim as proof for all the claims. (C) drawing a conclusion before examining the evidence, and only considering evidence that supports that conclusion. (D) asking a question that includes either an unproven assumption or more than one question, thus making a straightforward yes or no answer meaningless.\nA: Let's think step by step.
