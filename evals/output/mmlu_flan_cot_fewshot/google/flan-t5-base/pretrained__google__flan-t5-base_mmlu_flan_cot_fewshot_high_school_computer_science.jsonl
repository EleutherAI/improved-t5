        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following is an example of the use of a device on the Internet of Things (IoT) ?\n(A) A car alerts a driver that it is about to hit an object. (B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. (C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. (D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.\nA: Let's think step by step. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?\n(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. (B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. (C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. (D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user\u2019s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.\nIF (X < 0){\n DISPLAY (\"Foxtrot\")\n} ELSE {\n IF (X > Y){\n  DISPLAY (\"Hotel\")\n } ELSE {\n  IF (Y > 0){\n   DISPLAY (\"November\")\n  } ELSE {\n   DISPLAY (\"Yankee\")\n  }\n }\n}\nWhat is displayed as a result of running the program?\n(A) Foxtrot (B) Hotel (C) November (D) Yankee\nA: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY (\"November\") is executed. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the output of \"abc\"[::-1] in Python 3?\n(A) Error (B) abc (C) cba (D) c\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the slicing operator [::-1] takes all of the elements in the string in reverse order, so we reverse the order of the string \"abc\", resulting in \"cba\". The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.\n Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.\n Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater than 100, increase the value of count by 1.\n Step 3: (missing step)\n Step 4: (missing step)\n Step 5: Display the value of count.\nWhich of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?\n(A) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n(B) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of position is greater than n.\n(C) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.\n(D) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever. The answer is (B).Q: In Python 3, which of the following function removes all leading and trailing whitespace in string?\n(A) replace(old, new [, max]) (B) strip([chars]) (C) swapcase() (D) title()\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following is an example of the use of a device on the Internet of Things (IoT) ?\n(A) A car alerts a driver that it is about to hit an object. (B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. (C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. (D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.\nA: Let's think step by step. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?\n(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. (B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. (C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. (D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user\u2019s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.\nIF (X < 0){\n DISPLAY (\"Foxtrot\")\n} ELSE {\n IF (X > Y){\n  DISPLAY (\"Hotel\")\n } ELSE {\n  IF (Y > 0){\n   DISPLAY (\"November\")\n  } ELSE {\n   DISPLAY (\"Yankee\")\n  }\n }\n}\nWhat is displayed as a result of running the program?\n(A) Foxtrot (B) Hotel (C) November (D) Yankee\nA: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY (\"November\") is executed. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the output of \"abc\"[::-1] in Python 3?\n(A) Error (B) abc (C) cba (D) c\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the slicing operator [::-1] takes all of the elements in the string in reverse order, so we reverse the order of the string \"abc\", resulting in \"cba\". The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.\n Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.\n Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater than 100, increase the value of count by 1.\n Step 3: (missing step)\n Step 4: (missing step)\n Step 5: Display the value of count.\nWhich of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?\n(A) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n(B) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of position is greater than n.\n(C) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.\n(D) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever. The answer is (B).Q: In Python 3, let r = lambda q: q * 2.

Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever. The answer is (B).Q: Which types of functions grow the slowest?\n(A) O(N^(1/2)) (B) O(N^(1/4)) (C) O(N^(1/N)) (D) O(N)\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school computer science.\n\nQ: Which of the following is an example of the use of a device on the Internet of Things (IoT) ?\n(A) A car alerts a driver that it is about to hit an object. (B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. (C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. (D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.\nA: Let's think step by step. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?\n(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. (B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. (C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. (D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user\u2019s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In the program below, the initial value of X is 5 and the initial value of Y is 10.\nIF (X < 0){\n DISPLAY (\"Foxtrot\")\n} ELSE {\n IF (X > Y){\n  DISPLAY (\"Hotel\")\n } ELSE {\n  IF (Y > 0){\n   DISPLAY (\"November\")\n  } ELSE {\n   DISPLAY (\"Yankee\")\n  }\n }\n}\nWhat is displayed as a result of running the program?\n(A) Foxtrot (B) Hotel (C) November (D) Yankee\nA: Let's think step by step. Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY (\"November\") is executed. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: What is the output of \"abc\"[::-1] in Python 3?\n(A) Error (B) abc (C) cba (D) c\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the slicing operator [::-1] takes all of the elements in the string in reverse order, so we reverse the order of the string \"abc\", resulting in \"cba\". The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.\n Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.\n Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater than 100, increase the value of count by 1.\n Step 3: (missing step)\n Step 4: (missing step)\n Step 5: Display the value of count.\nWhich of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?\n(A) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n(B) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.\n  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of position is greater than n.\n(C) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.\n(D) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.\n  Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.\nA: Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever. The answer is (B).Q: Which is a valid expression in Python 3.5?\n(A) sort('ab') (B) sorted('ab') (C) \"ab\".sort() (D) 1/0\nA: Let's think step by step.",
