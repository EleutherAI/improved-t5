We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The median survival time to AIDS and death was established as a result of the development of seroconverters. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a morphological characteristic of the paramyxoviruses.\n(A) Fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing from the inside (B) Elongate viruses (C) Icosahedral viruses with envelope (D) Very large viruses\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paramyxoviruses are fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing from the inside. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The most important goal of a behavioral intervention is:\n(A) Change in behavior (B) Comprehensive coverage (C) Effective use of behavioral theory (D) Sustained behavior change\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The prim goal of a behavioral intervention is to cause sustained behavior change. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A key factor facilitating the application of nested case-control studies from the MACS was:\n(A) Data collection (B) Establishment of a repository of biologic specimens (C) Participant interest (D) Administration of the questionnaire by staff\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study's use of nested case-control studies was facilitated by the establishment of a repository of biologic specimens. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?\n(A) Because they have no nucleic acid (B) They require a helper virus (C) Only replicate in dividing cells (D) Can integrate into host chromosomes\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid. The answer is (A).Q: An observational study in diabetics assesses the role of an increased plasma fibrinogen level on the risk of cardiac events. 130 diabetic patients are followed for 5 years to assess the development of acute coronary syndrome. In the group of 60 patients with a normal baseline plasma fibrinogen level, 20 develop acute coronary syndrome and 40 do not. In the group of 70 patients with a high baseline plasma fibrinogen level, 40 develop acute coronary syndrome and 30 do not. Which of the following is the best estimate of relative risk in patients with a high baseline plasma fibrinogen level compared to patients with a normal baseline plasma fibrinogen level?\n(A) (40/30)/(20/40) (B) (40*40)/(20*30) (C) (40*70)/(20*60) (D) (40/70)/(20/60)\nA: Let's think step by step.",
