        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college chemistry.\n\nQ: 3 Cl\u2212(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2\u2212(aq) + 23 H+(aq) \u2192 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq) behaves as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D). The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following statements about the lanthanide elements is NOT true?\n(A) The most common oxidation state for the lanthanide elements is +3. (B) Lanthanide complexes often have high coordination numbers (> 6). (C) All of the lanthanide elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen. (D) The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La to Lu.\nA: Let's think step by step. The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements in fact decrease across the period from La to Lu. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all true. This means that only (D) is NOT true. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?\n(A) PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4 (B) PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 (C) CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 (D) CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4\nA: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3\u2022), assuming the lines do not overlap.\n(A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 6 (D) 24 (E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = \nrac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (E).Q: Which of the following is true for Br2 at standard temperature and pressure?\n(A) It is a colorless gas. (B) It is a red-brown volatile liquid.

The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?\n(A) PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4 (B) PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 (C) CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 (D) CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4\nA: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (A). The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3\u2022), assuming the lines do not overlap.\n(A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 6 (D) 24 (E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = \nrac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (E).Q: The anhydride of Ba(OH)2 is\n(A) BaH2 (B) BaOH (C) Ba (D) BaO\nA: Let's think step by step.",

In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq) behaves as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D).
